# Machine Learning Engineer

This repo contains my work to Udacity nanodegree [Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). I'm glad to have chosen this nano-degree and finished within 4 weeks. I gained hands-on experiences on ML pipeline in SageMaker and was exposed to a couple of interesting problems.

## Table of Contents

1. Software Engineering Fundamentals: Publish a simple [PyPi package](https://github.com/scumabo/Number-Guessing-Game) to practice software engineering fundamentals, e.g., modular code, optimize speed and memory, Docstrings, version control, unit tests, logging, and code review.

2. [Machine Learning in Production](SentimentLSTM): Use Sagemaker to develop, train, validate, and deploy a sentiment analysis on the movie review model using RNN in Pytorch. Hook the simple web app with the deployed endpoint using Lambda and API Gateway services in AWS.

3. [Plagiarism Detection](plagiarism_detection): Build a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.


4. [Capstone Project: Stock Prediction](Capstone_stock_prediction): The purpose of the capstone project is to leverage everything learned throughout the program to build an own machine learning engineer project. I build a simple stocker predictor using Pytorch's LSTM in SageMaker. The goal is not to accurately predict the stock market but to gain hands-on experiences on the ML pipeline in SageMaker including data acquisition, data preprocessing and exploration, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The project is summarized in the [report](Capstone_stock_prediction/MLND_Capstone_Project_Report.pdf).
